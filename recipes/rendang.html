    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Rendang is a traditional Indonesian and Malaysian dish made with tender, slow-cooked beef in a rich and flavorful coconut milk and spice broth. It is a true labor of love, as the beef is simmered for hours until it is melt-in-your-mouth tender and the sauce has thickened and reduced to a thick and fragrant paste. The result is a dish that is rich, savory, and explosively flavorful, with a depth of taste that is truly unique. If you've never tried rendang before, trust us, you're in for a treat!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the paste:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 shallots, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger, thumb-sized piece</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1-4 small red chiles (such as bird chiles), minced or 1-2 tsp red chili flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the rendang</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs beef, sirloin preferred, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2-3 stalks lemongrass, bottom part only (not leafy parts), outer layer peeled and bashed with blunt end of knife</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp allspice</li>
        <li>2 cans coconut milk, divided</li>
        <li>Oil as needed (about 2 tbsp) for browning beef</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice for serving</li>             
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the paste</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the shallots, ginger, garlic, and chilis to a small blender or food processor.</li>
            <li>Pulse the ingredients until they form a paste, scraping down the sides as needed. Set the paste aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>To make the rendang</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the beef in batches and sear until well browned. Remove the beef and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to medium-low and add the prepared paste to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the lemongrass, turmeric, coriander, and allspice to the pan. Cook the mixture, stirring often, until it takes on some color and appears dry. Be careful not to burn the mixture.</li>
            <li>Return the beef, along with any juices, to the pan. Stir in the first can of coconut milk.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar and adjust the heat to a very low simmer.</li> 
            <li>Simmer the mixture, stirring every 15 minutes or so, until the liquid is mostly evaporated and there is about an inch left in the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining can of coconut milk to the pan.</li> 
            <li>Continue to simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the beef is fork-tender and the sauce has reduced to a thick curry-like consistency. Take care not to break up the meat as you stir.</li>
            <li>When the rendang is finished, the beef should be coated in a thick curry sauce. Remove the lemongrass stalks and serve the rendang with rice.</li>      
        </ul>
    </ol>
